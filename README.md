# Laravel 5.x Integration with SagePay

To my knowledge, Laravel lacks any SagePay Integration package. This was why I decided to write this package. The package integrates with the SagePay forms although I believe it can be integrated with the other versions of the SagePay payment. I will look into that.

## Installation ##

To install just use composer and run the command:

composer require kofikwarteng/laravel-sagepay

Alternatively, you can add it to the require block in your composer.json file and run composer install
